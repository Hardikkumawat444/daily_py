# pattern printing programs

# for i in range (7):
#     for j in range (i+1):
#         print('*',end='')
#     print()


for i in range (6):
    print() 

# the reason why we added  i instead of i+1 as we did in the first case is becuase when starting from 0, 5 is not counted 
# but when starting from 5, 5 is counted and the loop goes on till 1 and then ends giving us the perfect answer
